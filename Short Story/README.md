PROBLEM STATEMENT

This is individual assignment

 

I have already approved the topics in spreadsheet 

 

submit the github directory link - with public access - also add the link to the spreadsheet as well. 

have a proper read.me file 

 Turn the content of the paper/topic into a nice article (PLEASE REMEMBER - DO NOT SUBMIT EXISTING MEDIUM ARTICLE - YOU HAVE TO WRITE MEDIUM ARTICLE FROM SCRATCH AND PUBLISH IT  - not cut and paste test - paraphrase and rewrite summarize)  for publishing in medium.com (add more survey papers content together as well) - focus on gist rather than math depth - focus on architecture, ablation studies, metrics etc.,. rather than going into the weeds deeply. as many pictures and visualizations and your own two cents on papers.  

Prepare a medium.com article - few pages long - and a slide deck explaining the short story - publish in medium.com and presentation on slideshare.com

 

submit the medium.com article  and slideshare link 

record a 10 - 15 minute video with slides (pdf or ppt)  and upload it to the github directory
