Here's a prompt for developing an intermediate-level application:\n\n\"Develop a cross-platform task management application that helps users organize their daily tasks and increase productivity. The application should have the following features:\n\n1. **User Authentication**: Implement a user registration and login system to allow users to create and manage their accounts.\n\n2. **Task Management**: Allow users to create, edit, and delete tasks. Each task should have a title, description, due date, priority level, and status (e.g., not started, in progress, completed).\n\n3. **Task Categories**: Implement a feature that lets users categorize their tasks into different categories or projects. Users should be able to create, edit, and delete categories.\n\n4. **Task Filtering and Sorting**: Provide options for users to filter and sort their tasks based on criteria such as due date, priority, status, or category.\n\n5. **Reminders and Notifications**: Allow users to set reminders for their tasks, and send notifications (e.g., email or in-app) when a task is due or when there are updates to tasks.\n\n6. **User Profiles**: Give users the ability to customize their profiles with avatars, usernames, and other optional information.\n\n7. **Collaboration and Sharing**: Implement the option for users to share tasks or entire projects with other users. Collaborators should be able to view and edit shared tasks.\n\n8. **Data Synchronization**: Ensure that user data is synchronized across devices and platforms. Users should be able to access their tasks and data on mobile devices, web browsers, and desktop applications.\n\n9. **Offline Support**: Allow users to work on tasks and make changes even when they are offline. Changes should be synced when the device is back online.\n\n10. **Data Backup and Recovery**: Provide an option for users to back up their task data and restore it in case of accidental data loss or device changes.\n\n11. **Analytics and Insights**: Implement analytics to help users track their task completion rates, productivity trends, and insights into their task management habits.\n\n12. **User-Friendly Interface**: Design an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing user interface (UI) that offers an enjoyable user experience.\n\n13. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Develop the application to run on multiple platforms, such as iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and web browsers, using a framework like Flutter, React Native, or Electron.\n\n14. **Security**: Implement strong security measures to protect user data, including encryption, secure authentication, and authorization.\n\n15. **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Conduct thorough testing, including unit testing, integration testing, and usability testing, to ensure the application's stability and reliability.\n\n16. **Documentation and Support**: Provide user documentation and support resources, including FAQs and a contact channel for user inquiries.\n\n17. **Localization**: Consider adding localization support to make the application accessible to users from different regions by providing translations for in-app text.\n\nPlease create a detailed software design document outlining the application's architecture, user interface design, and functionality. Begin development using a suitable programming language and development framework for your chosen platforms. The goal is to create a feature-rich task management application that helps users streamline their daily tasks and enhance their productivity.\"", "additional_kwargs": {}, "example": false}}, {"type": "ai", "data": {"content": "Here are the areas that need clarification:\n\n1.

Here are my assumptions based on the given prompt:\n\n1. User Authentication: The application will use a traditional email-password system for user registration and login. It will also provide options for social media and single sign-on (SSO) authentication.\n\n2. Task Management: The maximum length for the title of tasks will be 50 characters, and for the description, it will be 500 characters.\n\n3. Task Categories: A user can create up to 10 categories.\n\n4. Task Filtering and Sorting: The application will include criteria such as due date, priority, status, and category for task filtering and sorting.\n\n5. Reminders and Notifications: The application will send daily notifications for due tasks and immediate notifications for updates to tasks.\n\n6. User Profiles: Users can add optional information such as their full name, contact number, and a brief bio to their profiles.\n\n7. Collaboration and Sharing: Collaborators will have view and edit access to shared tasks.\n\n8. Data Synchronization: The application will synchronize data across iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and web browsers.\n\n9. Offline Support: Changes made offline will be synced when the device is back online and connected to the internet.\n\n10. Data Backup and Recovery: Data backup will occur daily.\n\n11. Analytics and Insights: The application will track metrics such as task completion rates, productivity trends, and time spent on tasks.\n\n12. User-Friendly Interface: The application will have a clean, minimalist design with intuitive navigation.\n\n13. Cross-Platform Compatibility: The application will be compatible with iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and web browsers.\n\n14. Security: The application will implement encryption, secure authentication, and authorization to protect user data.\n\n15. Testing and Quality Assurance: The application will undergo unit testing, integration testing, and usability testing.\n\n16. Documentation and Support: The application will provide a FAQ section and a contact form for user inquiries.\n\n17.
