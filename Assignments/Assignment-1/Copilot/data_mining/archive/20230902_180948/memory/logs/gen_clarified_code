Here's a prompt for developing an intermediate-level application:\n\n\"Develop a cross-platform task management application that helps users organize their daily tasks and increase productivity. The application should have the following features:\n\n1. **User Authentication**: Implement a user registration and login system to allow users to create and manage their accounts.\n\n2. **Task Management**: Allow users to create, edit, and delete tasks. Each task should have a title, description, due date, priority level, and status (e.g., not started, in progress, completed).\n\n3. **Task Categories**: Implement a feature that lets users categorize their tasks into different categories or projects. Users should be able to create, edit, and delete categories.\n\n4. **Task Filtering and Sorting**: Provide options for users to filter and sort their tasks based on criteria such as due date, priority, status, or category.\n\n5. **Reminders and Notifications**: Allow users to set reminders for their tasks, and send notifications (e.g., email or in-app) when a task is due or when there are updates to tasks.\n\n6. **User Profiles**: Give users the ability to customize their profiles with avatars, usernames, and other optional information.\n\n7. **Collaboration and Sharing**: Implement the option for users to share tasks or entire projects with other users. Collaborators should be able to view and edit shared tasks.\n\n8. **Data Synchronization**: Ensure that user data is synchronized across devices and platforms. Users should be able to access their tasks and data on mobile devices, web browsers, and desktop applications.\n\n9. **Offline Support**: Allow users to work on tasks and make changes even when they are offline. Changes should be synced when the device is back online.\n\n10. **Data Backup and Recovery**: Provide an option for users to back up their task data and restore it in case of accidental data loss or device changes.\n\n11. **Analytics and Insights**: Implement analytics to help users track their task completion rates, productivity trends, and insights into their task management habits.\n\n12. **User-Friendly Interface**: Design an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing user interface (UI) that offers an enjoyable user experience.\n\n13. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Develop the application to run on multiple platforms, such as iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and web browsers, using a framework like Flutter, React Native, or Electron.\n\n14. **Security**: Implement strong security measures to protect user data, including encryption, secure authentication, and authorization.\n\n15. **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Conduct thorough testing, including unit testing, integration testing, and usability testing, to ensure the application's stability and reliability.\n\n16. **Documentation and Support**: Provide user documentation and support resources, including FAQs and a contact channel for user inquiries.\n\n17. **Localization**: Consider adding localization support to make the application accessible to users from different regions by providing translations for in-app text.\n\nPlease create a detailed software design document outlining the application's architecture, user interface design, and functionality.

This file defines the URL routes for the Django project.\n\nurls.py\n```python\n\"\"\"task_manager URL Configuration\n\nThe `urlpatterns` list routes URLs to views.

Learn more: https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals\nreportWebVitals();\n```\n\nThis is the default React `index.js` file. It renders the `App` component into the root element of the HTML document.\n\nThe `App` component and other components (`User`, `Task`, `Category`, `Notification`, `Collaboration`, `Analytics`) would be defined in separate files and imported into `index.js` or other component files as needed.\n\nDue to the complexity of the application and the limitations of this platform, it's not feasible to provide the full code for all the components and other parts of the application. However, I hope this gives you a good starting point for developing the application.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "example": false}}]
