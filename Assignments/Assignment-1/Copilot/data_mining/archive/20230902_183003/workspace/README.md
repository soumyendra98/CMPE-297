Assumptions:

1. The user will input the list of ingredients as a comma-separated string.
2. The user can edit the list of ingredients by simply modifying the input field.
3. The recipe categories (vegetarian, non-vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, dietary) will be implemented as a dropdown menu.
4. The recipe recommendations will be differentiated into beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels based on the number of ingredients and complexity of the recipe.
5. The application will be built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind for the frontend, and Flask for the backend.
6. The application will be hosted on a server and accessible via a single URL.
7. The 'submit' or 'get recipes' button will trigger a request to the backend, which will return a list of recipe suggestions that will be displayed on the same page.
8. The application will be styled using Tailwind CSS.

Core Classes, Functions, Methods:

1. `Recipe` class: This class will represent a recipe, with properties like name, ingredients, category, and difficulty level.
2. `get_recipes` function: This function will take a list of ingredients and a category as input, and return a list of `Recipe` objects that match the criteria.
3. `display_recipes` function: This function will take a list of `Recipe` objects and display them on the webpage.
