The core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary are:

1. User: This class will represent a user of the application. It will have attributes for dietary preferences, available ingredients, and cooking skills.

2. Recipe: This class will represent a recipe. It will have attributes for ingredients, dietary information, and difficulty level.

3. Recommender: This class will be responsible for recommending recipes based on a user's preferences, available ingredients, and cooking skills.

4. get_user_preferences: This function will get a user's dietary preferences, available ingredients, and cooking skills.

5. get_recipe_data: This function will get the data for all recipes.

6. recommend_recipes: This method will recommend recipes based on a user's preferences, available ingredients, and cooking skills.

Now, let's start with the "entrypoint" file, which is the main.py file.

main.py
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request
from user import User
from recommender import Recommender

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def index():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        user = User(request.form)
        recommender = Recommender(user)
        recommended_recipes = recommender.recommend_recipes()
        return render_template('index.html', recommended_recipes=recommended_recipes)
    return render_template('index.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

user.py
```python
class User:
    def __init__(self, form_data):
        self.dietary_preferences = form_data.getlist('dietary_preferences')
        self.available_ingredients = form_data.get('available_ingredients').split(',')
        self.cooking_skills = form_data.get('cooking_skills')
```

recommender.py
```python
from recipe import Recipe

class Recommender:
    def __init__(self, user):
        self.user = user
        self.recipes = Recipe.get_all()

    def recommend_recipes(self):
        recommended_recipes = []
        for recipe in self.recipes:
            if self.user.cooking_skills >= recipe.difficulty_level and \
               set(recipe.ingredients).issubset(set(self.user.available_ingredients)) and \
               recipe.dietary_info in self.user.dietary_preferences:
                recommended_recipes.append(recipe)
        return recommended_recipes
```

recipe.py
```python
class Recipe:
    @staticmethod
    def get_all():
        # This method should return all recipes from the database.
        # For simplicity, we will return a list of dummy recipes.
        return [
            Recipe(['lettuce', 'tomato', 'cucumber'], 'vegan', 1),
            Recipe(['chicken', 'lettuce', 'tomato'], 'high-protein', 2),
            Recipe(['beef', 'lettuce', 'tomato'], 'low-carb', 3)
        ]

    def __init__(self, ingredients, dietary_info, difficulty_level):
        self.ingredients = ingredients
        self.dietary_info = dietary_info
        self.difficulty_level = difficulty_level
```

This is a simple implementation of the intelligent recipe recommender. It uses the Flask web framework to create a single page web application. The user inputs their dietary preferences, available ingredients, and cooking skills, and the system recommends recipes based on this information. The system currently uses dummy data for the recipes, but this can be replaced with a database query to get real recipes.
