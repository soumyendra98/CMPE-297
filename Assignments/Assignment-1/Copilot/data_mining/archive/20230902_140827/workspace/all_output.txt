Given the complexity of the project, we will use Python for backend development due to its extensive libraries and frameworks that support web development and machine learning. For the frontend, we will use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS as specified. We will use Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python, to handle the backend.

Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. User class: This class will represent a user with attributes such as dietary preferences, ingredient inventory, cooking skill level, and previous interactions.

2. Recipe class: This class will represent a recipe with attributes such as ingredients, cooking instructions, dietary information, and cuisine type.

3. Recommender class: This class will handle the recommendation logic. It will have methods to recommend recipes based on user profile and available ingredients.

4. User methods: Methods to update user profile, ingredient inventory, and cooking skill level.

5. Recipe methods: Methods to search for recipes by cuisine or specific ingredients.

6. Recommender methods: Methods to recommend new recipes based on user profile and available ingredients, and to improve recommendations over time using machine learning algorithms.

Now, let's start with the "entrypoint" file, which is the main.py file in Flask.

main.py
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request
from user import User
from recipe import Recipe
from recommender import Recommender

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/profile', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def profile():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Update user profile
        pass
    return render_template('profile.html')

@app.route('/inventory', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def inventory():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Update ingredient inventory
        pass
    return render_template('inventory.html')

@app.route('/recommendations')
def recommendations():
    # Get recipe recommendations
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Next, we will define the User, Recipe, and Recommender classes in separate files.

user.py
```python
class User:
    def __init__(self, dietary_preferences, ingredient_inventory, cooking_skill_level, previous_interactions):
        self.dietary_preferences = dietary_preferences
        self.ingredient_inventory = ingredient_inventory
        self.cooking_skill_level = cooking_skill_level
        self.previous_interactions = previous_interactions

    def update_profile(self, dietary_preferences, cooking_skill_level):
        self.dietary_preferences = dietary_preferences
        self.cooking_skill_level = cooking_skill_level

    def update_inventory(self, ingredient_inventory):
        self.ingredient_inventory = ingredient_inventory
```

recipe.py
```python
class Recipe:
    def __init__(self, ingredients, cooking_instructions, dietary_information, cuisine_type):
        self.ingredients = ingredients
        self.cooking_instructions = cooking_instructions
        self.dietary_information = dietary_information
        self.cuisine_type = cuisine_type

    def search_by_cuisine(self, cuisine_type):
        # Search for recipes by cuisine
        pass

    def search_by_ingredients(self, ingredients):
        # Search for recipes by specific ingredients
        pass
```

recommender.py
```python
class Recommender:
    def __init__(self, user, recipes):
        self.user = user
        self.recipes = recipes

    def recommend(self):
        # Recommend recipes based on user profile and available ingredients
        pass

    def improve_recommendations(self):
        # Improve recommendations over time using machine learning algorithms
        pass
```

For the frontend, we will create HTML files for the home page, user profile page, and ingredient inventory page. We will use Tailwind CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.

index.html
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Intelligent Recipe Recommender</title>
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss@2.2.16/dist/tailwind.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to the Intelligent Recipe Recommender!</h1>
    <!-- Add more HTML and JavaScript here -->
</body>
</html>
```

profile.html
```html
<!-- Similar to index.html, but specific to the user profile page -->
```

inventory.html
```html
<!-- Similar to index.html, but specific to the ingredient inventory page -->
```

Finally, we will create a requirements.txt file to specify the Python dependencies.

requirements.txt
```txt
flask==1.1.2
```

Please note that this is a simplified version of the application. The actual implementation would require a database to store user profiles and recipes, a more sophisticated frontend with user authentication, and a more complex recommendation system that uses machine learning algorithms.
