Given the complexity of the project, we will use Python for backend development due to its extensive libraries and frameworks that support web development and machine learning. For the frontend, we will use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS as specified. We will use Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python, to handle the backend.

Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. User class: This class will represent a user with attributes such as dietary preferences, ingredient inventory, cooking skill level, and previous interactions.

2. Recipe class: This class will represent a recipe with attributes such as ingredients, cooking instructions, dietary information, and cuisine type.

3. Recommender class: This class will handle the recommendation logic. It will have methods to recommend recipes based on user profile and available ingredients.

4. User methods: Methods to update user profile, ingredient inventory, and cooking skill level.

5. Recipe methods: Methods to search for recipes by cuisine or specific ingredients.

6. Recommender methods: Methods to recommend new recipes based on user profile and available ingredients, and to improve recommendations over time using machine learning algorithms.

Now, let's start with the "entrypoint" file, which is the main.py file in Flask.
