Given the requirements and assumptions, we will need to create a simple web application. We will use Flask as our backend framework and HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the frontend. 

Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `app.py`: This is the main entry point of our application. It will contain the Flask application and routes.
2. `templates/index.html`: This is the main HTML file that will display the user interface.
3. `static/css/styles.css`: This is the CSS file that will contain all the styles for our application.
4. `static/js/main.js`: This is the JavaScript file that will handle the interactivity of our application.

Now, let's create the content of each file:

app.py
