It will have methods to initialize the board, place the snakes and ladders, and move the players.\n\n3. `Dice`: A class to represent the dice. It will have a method to roll the dice and return a random number between 1 and 6.\n\n4. `Game`: A class to control the game flow. It will have methods to start the game, take turns, check for win conditions, and restart the game.\n\n5. `main`: The entry point of the program.
