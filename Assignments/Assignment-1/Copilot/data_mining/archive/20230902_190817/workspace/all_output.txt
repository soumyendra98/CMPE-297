The core classes, functions, and methods necessary for this game are:

1. `Player`: A class to represent a player. It will have attributes for the player's name and current position on the board.

2. `GameBoard`: A class to represent the game board. It will have methods to initialize the board, place the snakes and ladders, and move the players.

3. `Dice`: A class to represent the dice. It will have a method to roll the dice and return a random number between 1 and 6.

4. `Game`: A class to control the game flow. It will have methods to start the game, take turns, check for win conditions, and restart the game.

5. `main`: The entry point of the program. It will create the game, players, and board, and start the game.

Now, let's write the code for each of these components.

player.py
```python
class Player:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.position = 1
```

gameboard.py
```python
import random

class GameBoard:
    def __init__(self, size=10):
        self.size = size
        self.board = self.initialize_board()

    def initialize_board(self):
        board = [0] * (self.size * self.size + 1)
        for _ in range(5):
            start_snake = random.randint(2, self.size * self.size - 1)
            end_snake = random.randint(1, start_snake - 1)
            board[start_snake] = -end_snake

            start_ladder = random.randint(2, self.size * self.size - 1)
            end_ladder = random.randint(start_ladder + 1, self.size * self.size)
            board[start_ladder] = end_ladder
        return board

    def move_player(self, player, roll):
        player.position += roll
        if player.position > self.size * self.size:
            player.position -= roll
            return
        while self.board[player.position] != 0:
            if self.board[player.position] > 0:
                player.position = self.board[player.position]
            else:
                player.position = -self.board[player.position]
```

dice.py
```python
import random

class Dice:
    @staticmethod
    def roll():
        return random.randint(1, 6)
```

game.py
```python
from player import Player

        self.players = [Player(player1), Player(player2)]
        self.board = board
        self.dice = Dice()

    def start_game(self):
        while True:
            for player in self.players:
                roll = self.dice.roll()
                self.board.move_player(player, roll)
                print(f"{player.name} rolled a {roll} and is now on square {player.position}")
                if player.position == self.board.size * self.board.size:
                    print(f"{player.name} wins!")
                    return

    def restart_game(self):
        for player in self.players:
            player.position = 1
        self.board = GameBoard()
        self.start_game()
```

main.py
```python
from game import Game
from gameboard import GameBoard

def main():
    player1 = input("Enter the name of player 1: ")
    player2 = input("Enter the name of player 2: ")
    board = GameBoard()
    game = Game(player1, player2, board)
    game.start_game()
    while input("Do you want to play again? (yes/no) ").lower() == "yes":
        game.restart_game()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
