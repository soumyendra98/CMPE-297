Given the requirements, we will use Python with Flask for the backend, HTML/CSS/JS and Tailwind for the frontend, and SQLite for the database. We will also use scikit-learn for the machine learning part of the recommendation system.

Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. User class: This will represent a user with attributes like id, name, dietary preference, cooking skill level, and ingredient inventory.

2. Recipe class: This will represent a recipe with attributes like id, name, ingredients, dietary type, skill level required, and cuisine.

3. User methods: These will include methods to update the user's profile, update the ingredient inventory, and get recommended recipes.

4. Recipe methods: These will include methods to get a recipe by id, get recipes by cuisine, and get recipes by ingredients.

5. Recommendation system: This will include functions to train the recommendation model and get recommendations for a user.

Now, let's start with the entrypoint file, which is the main Flask application file.

app.py
