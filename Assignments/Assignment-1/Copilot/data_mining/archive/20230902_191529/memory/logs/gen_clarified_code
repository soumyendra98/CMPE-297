The game board is a 10x10 grid with numbered cells from 1 to 100.\n2. The game is played by two players.\n3. The snakes and ladders are placed randomly on the board at the start of each game.\n4. If a player lands on a square with the base of a ladder, they move to the square at the top of the ladder.\n5. If a player lands on a square with the head of a snake, they move to the square at the tail of the snake.\n6. The player who reaches the 100th square first is the winner.\n7. The game can be restarted manually by the players.\n\nCore classes, functions, methods:\n\n1. `Game`: This class represents the game itself. It has methods to start the game, roll the dice, move the players, check for snakes or ladders, and check if the game has been won.\n2. `Player`: This class represents a player. It has properties for the player's name and current position, and a method to move the player.\n3. `Board`: This class represents the game board. It has a method to generate the board with random snakes and ladders.\n4. `Dice`: This class represents the dice. It has a method to roll the dice and return a random number from 1 to 6.\n5. `Snake`: This class represents a snake. It has properties for the head and tail positions.\n6. `Ladder`: This class represents a ladder. It has properties for the base and top positions.\n\nNow, let's start with the \"entrypoint\" file, `main.py`.\n\nmain.py\n```python\nfrom game import Game\n\ndef main():\n    game = Game()\n    game.start()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\ngame.py\n```python\nfrom player import Player\nfrom board import Board\nfrom dice import Dice\n\nclass Game:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.players = [Player(\"Player 1\"), Player(\"Player 2\")]\n        self.board = Board()\n        self.dice = Dice()\n        self.current_player = 0\n\n    def start(self):\n        while not self.is_won():\n            self.play_turn()\n\n    def play_turn(self):\n        roll = self.dice.roll()\n        player = self.players[self.current_player]\n        player.move(roll)\n        self.check_snake_or_ladder(player)\n        self.current_player = (self.current_player + 1) % 2\n\n    def check_snake_or_ladder(self, player):\n        for snake in self.board.snakes:\n            if player.position == snake.head:\n                player.position = snake.tail\n        for ladder in self.board.ladders:\n            if player.position == ladder.base:\n                player.position = ladder.top\n\n    def is_won(self):\n        for player in self.players:\n            if player.position == 100:\n                print(f\"{player.name} wins!\")\n                return True\n        return False\n```\n\nplayer.py\n```python\nclass Player:\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n        self.position = 1\n\n    def move(self, steps):\n        self.position += steps\n        if self.position > 100:\n            self.position = 100\n```\n\nboard.py\n```python\nfrom snake import Snake\nfrom ladder import Ladder\nimport random\n\nclass Board:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.snakes = [Snake(random.randint(2, 99), random.randint(1, 98)) for _ in range(5)]\n        self.ladders = [Ladder(random.randint(1, 98), random.randint(2, 99)) for _ in range(5)]\n```\n\ndice.py\n```python\nimport random\n\nclass Dice:\n    def roll(self):\n        return random.randint(1, 6)\n```\n\nsnake.py\n```python\nclass Snake:\n    def __init__(self, head, tail):\n        self.head = head\n        self.tail = tail\n```\n\nladder.py\n```python\nclass Ladder:\n    def __init__(self, base, top):\n        self.base = base\n        self.top = top\n```\n\nrequirements.txt\n```txt\npython=3.8\n```\n\nThis is a simple console-based implementation of the game.
