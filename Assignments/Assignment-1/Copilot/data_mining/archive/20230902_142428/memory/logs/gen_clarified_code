It will have a method `recommend` that takes a `User` object and returns a list of `Recipe` objects.\n\n4. `app.py`: The entry point of the application. It will define the routes for the web application.\n\n5. `database.py`: A module to handle database operations. It will have functions to add, update, and retrieve users and recipes.\n\n6. `index.html`, `profile.html`, `recipe.html`: HTML files for the homepage, user profile page, and recipe page respectively.\n\n7. `style.css`: A CSS file to style the HTML pages.\n\n8. `script.js`: A JavaScript file to handle user interactions.\n\nNow, let's write the code for each file.\n\napp.py\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for\nfrom database import get_user, update_user, get_recipe, get_all_recipes\nfrom recommender import Recommender\nfrom user import User\nfrom recipe import Recipe\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef index():\n    return render_template('index.html')\n\n@app.route('/profile', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\ndef profile():\n    if request.method == 'POST':\n        user_id = request.form['user_id']\n        dietary_preferences = request.form['dietary_preferences']\n        available_ingredients = request.form['available_ingredients'].split(',')\n        cooking_skills = request.form['cooking_skills']\n        user = User(user_id, dietary_preferences, available_ingredients, cooking_skills)\n        update_user(user)\n        return redirect(url_for('recommendations', user_id=user_id))\n    else:\n        user_id = request.args.get('user_id')\n        user = get_user(user_id)\n        return render_template('profile.html', user=user)\n\n@app.route('/recommendations')\ndef recommendations():\n    user_id = request.args.get('user_id')\n    user = get_user(user_id)\n    recommender = Recommender(get_all_recipes())\n    recommended_recipes = recommender.recommend(user)\n    return render_template('recommendations.html', recipes=recommended_recipes)\n\n@app.route('/recipe')\ndef recipe():\n    recipe_id = request.args.get('recipe_id')\n    recipe = get_recipe(recipe_id)\n    return render_template('recipe.html', recipe=recipe)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\nuser.py\n```python\nclass User:\n    def __init__(self, user_id, dietary_preferences, available_ingredients, cooking_skills):\n        self.user_id = user_id\n        self.dietary_preferences = dietary_preferences\n        self.available_ingredients = available_ingredients\n        self.cooking_skills = cooking_skills\n```\n\nrecipe.py\n```python\nclass Recipe:\n    def __init__(self, recipe_id, ingredients, difficulty, dietary_category):\n        self.recipe_id = recipe_id\n        self.ingredients = ingredients\n        self.difficulty = difficulty\n        self.dietary_category = dietary_category\n```\n\nrecommender.py\n```python\nclass Recommender:\n    def __init__(self, all_recipes):\n        self.all_recipes = all_recipes\n\n    def recommend(self, user):\n        recommended_recipes = []\n        for recipe in self.all_recipes:\n            if user.dietary_preferences == recipe.dietary_category and set(user.available_ingredients).issubset(set(recipe.ingredients)) and user.cooking_skills == recipe.difficulty:\n                recommended_recipes.append(recipe)\n        return recommended_recipes\n```\n\ndatabase.py\n```python\nimport sqlite3\nfrom user import User\nfrom recipe import Recipe\n\ndef get_user(user_id):\n    conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')\n    c = conn.cursor()\n    c.execute('SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = ?', (user_id,))\n    row = c.fetchone()\n    conn.close()\n    if row is None:\n        return None\n    else:\n        return User(row[0], row[1], row[2].split(','), row[3])\n\ndef update_user(user):\n    conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')\n    c = conn.cursor()\n    c.execute('UPDATE users SET dietary_preferences = ?, available_ingredients = ?, cooking_skills = ?

The JavaScript file will handle form submissions and update the recipe display based on the recommendations.\n\nThe SQLite database will contain two tables: `users` and `recipes`. The `users` table will store the user ID, dietary preferences, available ingredients, and cooking skills. The `recipes` table will store the recipe ID, ingredients, difficulty level, and dietary category. The `get_user`, `update_user`, `get_recipe`, and `get_all_recipes` functions in the `database.py` module will perform the necessary database operations.\n\nThe `Recommender` class in the `recommender.py` module will recommend recipes based on a user's dietary preferences, available ingredients, and cooking skills. The `recommend` method will return a list of `Recipe` objects that match the user's dietary preferences, contain only the user's available ingredients, and are at the user's cooking skill level.\n\nThe `app.py` module will define the routes for the web application. The `index` route will render the homepage. The `profile` route will render the user profile page and handle form submissions to update the user's dietary preferences, available ingredients, and cooking skills. The `recommendations` route will render the recommended recipes for a user. The `recipe` route will render a specific recipe.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "example": false}}]
