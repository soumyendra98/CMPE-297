We will also use SQLite for the database.\n\nHere are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:\n\n1. `User`: A class to represent a user. It will have methods to get and set the user's dietary preferences, available ingredients, and cooking skills.\n\n2. `Recipe`: A class to represent a recipe. It will have methods to get and set the recipe's ingredients, difficulty level, and dietary category.\n\n3. `Recommender`: A class to recommend recipes based on a user's dietary preferences, available ingredients, and cooking skills. It will have a method `recommend` that takes a `User` object and returns a list of `Recipe` objects.\n\n4. `app.py`: The entry point of the application. It will define the routes for the web application.\n\n5. `database.py`: A module to handle database operations. It will have functions to add, update, and retrieve users and recipes.\n\n6. `index.html`, `profile.html`, `recipe.html`: HTML files for the homepage, user profile page, and recipe page respectively.\n\n7. `style.css`: A CSS file to style the HTML pages.\n\n8. `script.js`: A JavaScript file to handle user interactions.\n\nNow, let's write the code for each file.\n\napp.py\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for\nfrom database import get_user, update_user, get_recipe, get_all_recipes\nfrom recommender import Recommender\nfrom user import User\nfrom recipe import Recipe\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef index():\n    return render_template('index.html')\n\n@app.route('/profile', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\ndef profile():\n    if request.method == 'POST':\n        user_id = request.form['user_id']\n        dietary_preferences = request.form['dietary_preferences']\n        available_ingredients = request.form['available_ingredients'].split(',')\n        cooking_skills = request.form['cooking_skills']\n        user = User(user_id, dietary_preferences, available_ingredients, cooking_skills)\n        update_user(user)\n        return redirect(url_for('recommendations', user_id=user_id))\n    else:\n        user_id = request.args.get('user_id')\n        user = get_user(user_id)\n        return render_template('profile.html', user=user)\n\n@app.route('/recommendations')\ndef recommendations():\n    user_id = request.args.get('user_id')\n    user = get_user(user_id)\n    recommender = Recommender(get_all_recipes())\n    recommended_recipes = recommender.recommend(user)\n    return render_template('recommendations.html', recipes=recommended_recipes)\n\n@app.route('/recipe')\ndef recipe():\n    recipe_id = request.args.get('recipe_id')\n    recipe = get_recipe(recipe_id)\n    return render_template('recipe.html', recipe=recipe)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\nuser.py\n```python\nclass User:\n    def __init__(self, user_id, dietary_preferences, available_ingredients, cooking_skills):\n        self.user_id = user_id\n        self.dietary_preferences = dietary_preferences\n        self.available_ingredients = available_ingredients\n        self.cooking_skills = cooking_skills\n```\n\nrecipe.py\n```python\nclass Recipe:\n    def __init__(self, recipe_id, ingredients, difficulty, dietary_category):\n        self.recipe_id = recipe_id\n        self.ingredients = ingredients\n        self.difficulty = difficulty\n        self.dietary_category = dietary_category\n```\n\nrecommender.py\n```python\nclass Recommender:\n    def __init__(self, all_recipes):\n        self.all_recipes = all_recipes\n\n    def recommend(self, user):\n        recommended_recipes = []\n        for recipe in self.all_recipes:\n            if user.dietary_preferences == recipe.dietary_category and set(user.available_ingredients).issubset(set(recipe.ingredients)) and user.cooking_skills == recipe.difficulty:\n                recommended_recipes.append(recipe)\n        return recommended_recipes\n```\n\ndatabase.py\n```python\nimport sqlite3\nfrom user import User\nfrom recipe import Recipe\n\ndef get_user(user_id):\n    conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')\n    c = conn.cursor()\n    c.execute('SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = ?', (user_id,))\n    row = c.fetchone()\n    conn.close()\n    if row is None:\n        return None\n    else:\n        return User(row[0], row[1], row[2].split(','), row[3])\n\ndef update_user(user):\n    conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')\n    c = conn.cursor()\n    c.execute('UPDATE users SET dietary_preferences = ?, available_ingredients = ?, cooking_skills = ?

The HTML files will contain forms for users to input their dietary preferences, available ingredients, and cooking skills, and to display the recommended recipes. The CSS file will style these forms and the recipe display. The JavaScript file will handle form submissions and update the recipe display based on the recommendations.\n\nThe SQLite database will contain two tables: `users` and `recipes`. The `users` table will store the user ID, dietary preferences, available ingredients, and cooking skills. The `recipes` table will store the recipe ID, ingredients, difficulty level, and dietary category. The `get_user`, `update_user`, `get_recipe`, and `get_all_recipes` functions in the `database.py` module will perform the necessary database operations.\n\nThe `Recommender` class in the `recommender.py` module will recommend recipes based on a user's dietary preferences, available ingredients, and cooking skills. The `recommend` method will return a list of `Recipe` objects that match the user's dietary preferences, contain only the user's available ingredients, and are at the user's cooking skill level.\n\nThe `app.py` module will define the routes for the web application. The `index` route will render the homepage. The `profile` route will render the user profile page and handle form submissions to update the user's dietary preferences, available ingredients, and cooking skills. The `recommendations` route will render the recommended recipes for a user. The `recipe` route will render a specific recipe.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "example": false}}, {"type": "ai", "data": {"content": "To install the dependencies, you can use pip, a package manager for Python.
