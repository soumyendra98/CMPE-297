Given the requirements, we will use Python with Flask for the backend, and HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind for the frontend. We will also use SQLite for the database.

Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `User`: A class to represent a user. It will have methods to get and set the user's dietary preferences, available ingredients, and cooking skills.

2. `Recipe`: A class to represent a recipe. It will have methods to get and set the recipe's ingredients, difficulty level, and dietary category.

3. `Recommender`: A class to recommend recipes based on a user's dietary preferences, available ingredients, and cooking skills. It will have a method `recommend` that takes a `User` object and returns a list of `Recipe` objects.

4. `app.py`: The entry point of the application. It will define the routes for the web application.

5. `database.py`: A module to handle database operations. It will have functions to add, update, and retrieve users and recipes.

6. `index.html`, `profile.html`, `recipe.html`: HTML files for the homepage, user profile page, and recipe page respectively.

7. `style.css`: A CSS file to style the HTML pages.

8. `script.js`: A JavaScript file to handle user interactions.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

app.py
