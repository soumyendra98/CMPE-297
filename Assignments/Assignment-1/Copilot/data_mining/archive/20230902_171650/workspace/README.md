Given the constraints of using only HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, we will not be able to create a fully dynamic intelligent recipe recommender. However, we can create a static web page that simulates some of the functionalities. 

Here are the core files and their purposes:

1. `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that will serve as the entry point of the application. It will contain the main structure of the web page.

2. `styles.css`: This CSS file will contain all the custom styles used in the application.

3. `bootstrap.min.css`: This is the Bootstrap CSS file that will provide the Bootstrap styles.

4. `recipes.json`: This JSON file will contain a static list of recipes that the application will use to display the recipes.

Now, let's create the content of each file.

`index.html`
