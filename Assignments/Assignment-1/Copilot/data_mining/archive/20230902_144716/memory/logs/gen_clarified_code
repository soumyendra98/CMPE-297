The application will use a pre-existing database of recipes, each tagged with dietary preferences and skill level.\n2. The application will use a simple matching algorithm to recommend recipes based on user input. It will match the user's dietary preferences, skill level, and available ingredients with those of the recipes in the database.\n3. The user's list of available ingredients can be updated at any time, and the recommendations will be updated accordingly.\n4. The application will be implemented as a single-page web application, with the frontend in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind, and the backend in Python using the Flask framework.\n\nCore classes, functions, methods:\n\n1. `Recipe`: A class representing a recipe, with properties for the recipe's name, ingredients, dietary preferences, and skill level.\n2. `User`: A class representing a user, with properties for the user's dietary preferences, skill level, and available ingredients.\n3. `get_matching_recipes(user, recipes)`: A function that takes a `User` object and a list of `Recipe` objects, and returns a list of recipes that match the user's dietary preferences, skill level, and available ingredients.\n4. `update_user_ingredients(user, ingredients)`: A function that takes a `User` object and a list of ingredients, and updates the user's available ingredients.\n5. `app.py`: The entrypoint file for the Flask application, which defines the routes for the web application.\n6. `index.html`: The HTML file for the single-page web application, which includes forms for the user to input their dietary preferences, skill level, and available ingredients, and a section to display the recommended recipes.\n7. `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the web application.\n8. `scripts.js`: The JavaScript file for handling user input and updating the recommended recipes.\n\nNow, let's start with the entrypoint file, `app.py`.\n\napp.py\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request, jsonify\nfrom recipe import Recipe\nfrom user import User, update_user_ingredients, get_matching_recipes\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/recommend', methods=['POST'])\ndef recommend():\n    data = request.get_json()\n    user = User(data['dietary_preferences'], data['skill_level'], data['available_ingredients'])\n    recipes = [Recipe(**recipe_data) for recipe_data in data['recipes']]\n    matching_recipes = get_matching_recipes(user, recipes)\n    return jsonify([recipe.__dict__ for recipe in matching_recipes])\n\n@app.route('/update_ingredients', methods=['POST'])\ndef update_ingredients():\n    data = request.get_json()\n    user = User(data['dietary_preferences'], data['skill_level'], data['available_ingredients'])\n    update_user_ingredients(user, data['new_ingredients'])\n    return jsonify(user.__dict__)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\nNext, let's define the `Recipe` and `User` classes, and the `get_matching_recipes` and `update_user_ingredients` functions.\n\nrecipe.py\n```python\nclass Recipe:\n    def __init__(self, name, ingredients, dietary_preferences, skill_level):\n        self.name = name\n        self.ingredients = ingredients\n

available_ingredients):\n        self.dietary_preferences = dietary_preferences\n        self.skill_level = skill_level\n        self.available_ingredients = available_ingredients\n\ndef get_matching_recipes(user, recipes):\n    return [recipe for recipe in recipes if recipe.dietary_preferences == user.dietary_preferences and recipe.skill_level == user.skill_level and all(ingredient in user.available_ingredients for ingredient in recipe.ingredients)]\n\ndef update_user_ingredients(user, ingredients):\n    user.available_ingredients = ingredients\n```\n\nNow, let's move on to the
