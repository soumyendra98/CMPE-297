The core function that will be necessary is a function to generate the random numbers. This function will use the random module in Python to generate a list of random numbers within the specified range. The function will be named `generate_random_numbers`.

Here is the content of the file:

random_number_generator.py
```python
import random

def generate_random_numbers(quantity, start, end):
    """
    Generate a list of random numbers.

    Parameters:
    quantity (int): The number of random numbers to generate.
    start (int): The lower bound of the range of numbers.
    end (int): The upper bound of the range of numbers.

    Returns:
    list: A list of random numbers.
    """
    return [random.randint(start, end) for _ in range(quantity)]
```

This is the only file necessary for this code. It contains all necessary imports and the function is fully functional. The function takes in three parameters: the quantity of numbers to generate, and the start and end of the range of numbers. It returns a list of random numbers.

The requirements.txt file for this code is as follows:

requirements.txt
```txt
python==3.8.5
```

This file specifies that Python 3.8.5 is required to run the code. No other packages are necessary as the random module is part of the Python Standard Library.
