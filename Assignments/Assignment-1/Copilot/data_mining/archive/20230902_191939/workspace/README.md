Assumptions:

1. The starting and ending points of the snakes and ladders will be randomly generated.
2. The current position of each player will be displayed on the board with different colors for each player.
3. The game will be restarted by clicking a "Restart" button.

Core classes, functions, methods:

1. `GameBoard` class: This class will be responsible for creating the game board, placing the snakes and ladders, and updating the positions of the players.
2. `Player` class: This class will represent a player in the game. It will keep track of the player's current position on the board.
3. `Dice` class: This class will simulate a dice roll.
4. `startGame` function: This function will start the game by creating a new `GameBoard` and two `Player` instances.
5. `restartGame` function: This function will restart the game by resetting the `GameBoard` and `Player` instances.
