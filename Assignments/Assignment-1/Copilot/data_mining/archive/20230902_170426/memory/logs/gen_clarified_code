Here is a list of the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:\n\n1. `server.js`: This is the entry point of our application. It sets up our Express server and connects to the MongoDB database.\n\n2. `routes/recipeRoutes.js`: This file will contain all the routes related to recipes.\n\n3. `controllers/recipeController.js`: This file will contain all the logic related to recipes. It will have methods like `getRecipes`, `getRecipe`, `createRecipe`, `updateRecipe`, and `deleteRecipe`.\n\n4. `models/Recipe.js`: This file will define the schema for our Recipe model.\n\n5. `utils/recipeRecommender.js`: This file will contain the logic for recommending recipes based on user's dietary preferences, available ingredients, and cooking skills.\n\n6. `client/src/App.js`: This is the main React component that renders the application.\n\n7. `client/src/components/RecipeList.js`: This component will display the list of recommended recipes.\n\n8. `client/src/components/Recipe.js`: This component will display a single recipe.\n\n9. `client/src/components/SearchBar.js`: This component will allow users to search for recipes.\n\n10. `client/src/components/UserPreferences.js`: This component will allow users to set their dietary preferences and cooking skills.\n\nNow, let's start with the entry point of our application, `server.js`.\n\nserver.js\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst mongoose = require('mongoose');\nconst recipeRoutes = require('./routes/recipeRoutes');\n\nconst app = express();\n\nmongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/recipeRecommender', {\n  useNewUrlParser: true,\n  useUnifiedTopology: true,\n});\n\napp.use(express.json());\napp.use('/api/recipes', recipeRoutes);\n\nconst PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;\napp.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));\n```\n\nNext, let's define our routes in `routes/recipeRoutes.js`.\n\nroutes/recipeRoutes.js\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst recipeController = require('../controllers/recipeController');\n\nconst router = express.Router();\n\nrouter.get('/', recipeController.getRecipes);\nrouter.get('/:id', recipeController.getRecipe);\nrouter.post('/', recipeController.createRecipe);\nrouter.put('/:id', recipeController.updateRecipe);\nrouter.delete('/:id', recipeController.deleteRecipe);\n\nmodule.exports = router;\n```\n\nNow, let's define our controller in `controllers/recipeController.js`.\n\ncontrollers/recipeController.js\n```javascript\nconst Recipe = require('../models/Recipe');\nconst recipeRecommender = require('../utils/recipeRecommender');\n\nexports.getRecipes = async (req, res) => {\n  try {\n    const userPreferences = req.body;\n    const recipes = await Recipe.find();\n    const

Logic for recommending recipes goes here\n};\n```\n\nFinally, let's define our React components in `client/src/App.js`, `client/src/components/RecipeList.js`, `client/src/components/Recipe.js`, `client/src/components/SearchBar.js`, and `client/src/components/UserPreferences.js`.\n\nclient/src/App.js\n```javascript\nimport React from 'react';\nimport RecipeList from
