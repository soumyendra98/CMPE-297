Given the complexity of the application, we will need to create several files and directories to keep our code organized. Here is a list of the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `server.js`: This is the entry point of our application. It sets up our Express server and connects to the MongoDB database.

2. `routes/recipeRoutes.js`: This file will contain all the routes related to recipes.

3. `controllers/recipeController.js`: This file will contain all the logic related to recipes. It will have methods like `getRecipes`, `getRecipe`, `createRecipe`, `updateRecipe`, and `deleteRecipe`.

4. `models/Recipe.js`: This file will define the schema for our Recipe model.

5. `utils/recipeRecommender.js`: This file will contain the logic for recommending recipes based on user's dietary preferences, available ingredients, and cooking skills.

6. `client/src/App.js`: This is the main React component that renders the application.

7. `client/src/components/RecipeList.js`: This component will display the list of recommended recipes.

8. `client/src/components/Recipe.js`: This component will display a single recipe.

9. `client/src/components/SearchBar.js`: This component will allow users to search for recipes.

10. `client/src/components/UserPreferences.js`: This component will allow users to set their dietary preferences and cooking skills.

Now, let's start with the entry point of our application, `server.js`.
