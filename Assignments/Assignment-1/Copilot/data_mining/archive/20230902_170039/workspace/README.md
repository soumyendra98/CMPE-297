Given the complexity of the task, we will use Python for the backend and JavaScript (React) for the frontend. We will also use Flask as a lightweight web server to serve the Python application.

The core classes and functions will be:

Backend (Python):
1. `Recipe`: A class to represent a recipe.
2. `User`: A class to represent a user.
3. `get_recipes(user: User, ingredients: List[str]) -> List[Recipe]`: A function to get recommended recipes based on the user's dietary preferences, available ingredients, and cooking skills.

Frontend (React):
1. `App`: The main component of the application.
2. `SearchBar`: A component for the search bar where users can input their available ingredients.
3. `Filter`: A component for the filters where users can select their dietary preferences and cooking skills.
4. `RecipeList`: A component to display the recommended recipes.

Let's start with the backend.
