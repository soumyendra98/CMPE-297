The core classes, functions, and methods necessary for this project are:

1. `Recipe`: A class to represent a recipe. It will have attributes such as `name`, `ingredients`, `instructions`, `dietary_preferences`, and `skill_level`.

2. `RecipeRecommender`: A class to handle the recommendation logic. It will have methods such as `get_recipes_by_ingredients`, `get_recipes_by_dietary_preferences`, and `get_recipes_by_skill_level`.

3. `app`: A Flask application to serve the web page and handle requests.

4. `index`: A function to render the main page of the web application.

5. `search`: A function to handle search requests and return recommended recipes.

Now, let's start with the "entrypoint" file, which is `app.py`.
