PROBLEM STATEMENT

Provide seperate github directories under parent directory for all these assignments. provide all artifacts as well as for each assignment, a expanation screencast 

 

a) Simple Agents assignment

Build a very simple python agent and demonstrate multiple backend tools (use chatgpt to write the backends to various tools) - provide more tools than the hint as well as an outer loop.

b) Implement auto agent

Leverage auto agent to build a virtual company to do a project (use gpt4) and provide all the artifacts of the project. come up with novel example other than the hint file

c) Finetune LLM for your custom task

Use Lora to finetune the model - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11jJYgT6sZOtrwx6YK6-yqyfCMrO-j2KdA_-UuhSSQ1U/edit#slide=id.g28b63e79207_0_7014Links to an external site.   (see notes)
Create custom data sets and fine tune for this assignment

(colab in description)  and mistral slides

 

d) use QLora to finetune a model. generate custom data set.

e) use mistral llm with RAG and demonstrate a production usecase

deploy the finetuned model on production

 

f) integrate mistral model as backend with langchain - demonstrate simple prompts

(see notes)

 

g) Quantize llm with ggml and gguf and build an end2end chat application on mobile phone and load the model and demonstrate using MLC end2end.

 

h) Use LLM studio and LLM Data Studio to demonstrate data set generation, fine tuning, deployment to huggingface and inference (Gradio)
